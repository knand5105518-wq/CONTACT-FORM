# CONTACT-FORM
A simple and responsive contact form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes client-side validation to ensure that the Name, Email, and Message fields are correctly filled before submission. The form displays error messages for invalid inputs and a success message for valid submissions, without actually sending the data.
